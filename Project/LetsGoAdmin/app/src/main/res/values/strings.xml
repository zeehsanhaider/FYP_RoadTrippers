    <string name="sample_trip_description">Ganga choti is an excellent place to visit. From Islamabad
        to Sudhan Gali the road is perfect. Rest houses are available in sudhan gali such as benazir
        palace etc. Road conditions from Sudhan Gali to the base came is perfect for cars but keep
        in mind that it is ectremely steep. A two - three hours hike is required to reach the top
        from the base camp. The top is at 3,000m of altitude. The best thing about ganga is that
        throughout the hiking you\'d see and enjoy a perfect natural beauty and once you\'re at the
        top the scene is breathtaking. Ganga choti is way better than miranjani.
